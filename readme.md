## xim

xim is a multi-platform scheduler that supports standard cron expressions with six fields: Minute, Hour, Day of Month, Month, Day of Week, and Command.

xim handles non-standard expressions such as `@hourly` `@daily` `@weekly` `@monthly` `@yearly` `@annually` and `@reboot`

### ✨ Features
⭐ Provides detailed error handling for invalid cron expressions, ensuring that the parser returns meaningful error messages for easier debugging.

⭐ Calculates the duration until the next scheduled execution time for a given cron job.

⭐ Dynamically determines the last day of the month when encountering the "L" character in the DayOfMonth field.

⭐ Supports step values in cron fields, such as `*/5` in the minute field, indicating every 5 minutes.

⭐ Handles comma-separated values in cron fields, allowing multiple specific values to be specified (e.g., "1,15" in the day of month field).

⭐ Supports the use of `*` as a wildcard character, representing all values in a given field.

⭐ Removes duplicate values when encountering comma-separated values in cron fields.

⭐ Calculates the next scheduled time efficiently, considering the specific cron expression fields.

⭐ Allows for extension or modification based on specific use cases or additional features.
